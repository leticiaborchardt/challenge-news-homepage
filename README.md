## Overview

Hello! I really like frontend and I'm always practicing new styles. 
This time I discovered the Frontend Mentor, and it have so many cool things to work on!

I choose this challenge because its very interesting and beatiful, and I wanted to improve some skils :muscle:

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I recently started studying Sass and Gulp and started this challenge to improve my knowledge. 

I also wanted to work more with GRID and responsive designs, so the challenge was well spent and fun to do. 
I tried to apply the "BEM" pattern for naming style classes and I think I got a good result since it was my first time.

Obviously I have a lot to work on, but I felt satisfied with the results of this screens :)

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- Flexbox and Grid
- Javascript
- Gulp js

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/) - This helped me to organize my css classes. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Gulp js](https://gulpjs.com/) - This helped me to compile files and improve my development, it's a very good tool.
